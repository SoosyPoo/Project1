<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> My name is Jesus Santiago and thats my wife there Mercedes! </p>
<p> As a 20-year-old student at Springboard, I am passionately pursuing my goal of becoming an exceptional coder. Over the past few weeks, my focus has been on mastering the fundamentals of HTML. I find great satisfaction in the curriculum, and my confidence in my coding abilities are growing steadily. I am genuinely excited about the prospect of delving deeper into the world of coding and expanding my knowledge.</p>
